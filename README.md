## Description <a name="description"></a> 
This README Generator project is designed to help myself and other programmers who are interested quickly create READMEs for their applications by just answering a few questions through a command-line application. This way, more consideration can be given to the development and the README is more easily constructed.

## Credits <a name="credits"></a>
This project was refactored from the starter code in the Develop folder of the 02-Challenge folder with the 09-NodeJS module from the [UCSD-VIRT-FSF-PT-09-2023-U-LOLC](https://git.bootcampcontent.com/University-of-California---San-Diego/UCSD-VIRT-FSF-PT-09-2023-U-LOLC) GitLab repository. Thank you, user mvpache!

For the license rendering, I did a quick Google search and found
