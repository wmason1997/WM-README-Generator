[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64229311/how-do-you-create-a-link-to-a-specified-section-of-your-readme-md-file](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64229311/how-do-you-create-a-link-to-a-specified-section-of-your-readme-md-file) and after an hour of it not working and me trying different things, ChatGPT told me the "link format in Markdown is generally lowercase and hyphen-separated." So, I tried that and that worked.
